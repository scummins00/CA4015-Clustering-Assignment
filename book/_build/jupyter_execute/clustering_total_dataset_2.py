# # Clustering of Total Dataset 2 (Income Every 10th Turn)
# In the following Notebook, we will be examining and contrasting participants based on their total net income or net loss over the course the test measured at 10% completion intervals. That is to say that, for a participant with 100 turns, we will examine their *10th*, *20th*, *30th*, *40th*, *50th*, *60th*, *70th*, *80th*, *90th*, and *100th* round. Clustering participants based on these features will result in a **10-Dimensional space**. We will then perform *Principal Component Analysis* to understand which of these features are most important. Depending on the results of PCA, we will either perform dimensionality reduction or choose to continue with all 10 features.
