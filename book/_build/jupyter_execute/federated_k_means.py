# # Introduction to Federated Learning
# Federated Learning is a deep learning approach which involves training a model over disconnected or siloed data centres such as mobile phones. Rather than both the data and model being centralised on one system, data is preserved in its local environment. A machine learning model is sent to the system hosting the data, rather than the inverse. This approach makes a step forward in protecting the privacy of user-generated data. In FL, the user data is not transmitted across a network. However, there are challenges associated with FL, including: *the expensive nature*, *system heterogeneity*, *statistical heterogeneity*, and *privacy* {cite:p}Li2020 .
