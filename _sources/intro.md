## Introduction to the Iowa Gambling Task
This Jupyter Book will hold an analysis of data from 617 Healthy Participants Performing the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). The data, which originates from 10 individual studies, is pooled together by {cite}'Steingroever2015'. All participants are healthy (have no known neurological impairments). Participants were assessed on a computerised version of the IGT. The playing conditions vary between each study, with participant's attempts ranging between *95 - 150 tries*. The *payoff scheme* varies also, with some servers hosting **harsher penalties** and **more lucrative rewards**.  


## Introduction to Federated Learning
__*Federated Learning*__ (FL) is a deep learning approach which involves training a model over disconnected or siloed data centres such as mobile phones. Rather than both the data and model being centralised on one system, data is preserved in its local environment. A machine learning model is sent to the system hosting the data, rather than the inverse. This approach makes a step forward in protecting the privacy of user-generated data. In FL, the user data is not transmitted across a network. However, there are challenges associated with FL, including: *the expensive nature*, *system heterogeneity*, *statistical heterogeneity*, and *privacy* {cite}'Li2020' .
